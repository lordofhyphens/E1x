If using the 300x300 Y Carriage for the TAZ and the accompanying borosilicate glass plate, these corner pieces are recommended:

Otherwise, edit SCAD/lulz-cornermount to suit the size of your printbed.
The STL is pre-sized for a 12"x12" piece.

It is recommended to increase the Y extrusions to 485mm and the Y smooth rod length to 505mm. It may be advantageous to use 10mm smooth rods instead at these lengths. For 10mm smooth rods, either use LM10UU bearings or RJM-01-10 polymer bushings (https://www.lulzbot.com/products/solid-polymer-bearing-rjm-01-10mm) or nylon.

10mm bearing holder in STL Files is a copy of and was made by Lulzbot:
