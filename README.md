If using the 300x300 Y Carriage for the TAZ and the accompanying borosilicate glass plate, these corner pieces are recommended:

Otherwise, edit SCAD/lulz-cornermount to suit the size of your printbed.
The STL is pre-sized for a 12"x12" piece.

This variant employs Vslot on the X and Y axes. This arrangement is
experimental, it may take a few re-prints of parts to get things to line up
(particularly the Y axis parts with the printbed).

The X motor and idler endsshould be printed at 0.2mm layer height or lower.  If
using slic3r or another program capable of doing so, use 0.1mm layer heights
between 20.5mm and 21.1mm
